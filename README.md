# Disaster Arena

A natural disaster survival game.

Stranded on a strange planet with unsual day/night cycles you need to prepare and defend against natural disasters.
Keep the fires from spreading because with rising co2 levels you don't just get random fires: meteor storms and toxic clouds appear.
Save Guard your headquarter by building water towers to fight fires.

Compete with friends in Multiplayer for the best score while hurdling disasters their way.
