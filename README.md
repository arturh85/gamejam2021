A natural disaster survival game.

Stranded on a strange planet with unsual day/night cycles you need to prepare and defend against natural disasters.

Save Guard your headquarter by building water towers to fight fires.

Compete with friends in Multiplayer for the best score while hurdling disasters their way.
